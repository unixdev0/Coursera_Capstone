The city of Toronto has approached our company to help them develop a service that helps the enterpreneurs who want to establish new businesses in the city of Toronto. This service will help find ideal locations for the new businesses based on such factors as business venue density in the area, the crime rate in the area, the proximity to other business venues.

Having a tool that can help the enterpreneurs to choose the right location for their business will assure long and prosperous existance for such businesses, serving the community and helping it grow. 

### Business Problem Solution

In order to advise the enterpreneurs a good location, we will consider the density of similar businesses in the desired area/neighbourhood and the crime rate in the same area.
